# PART 1 CONSTANTS
# Constants to be modified prior to running
# Note that there is a strong correlation with the AR and the sweep angle. Convergence will be difficult for high AR wings at extreme forward or aft sweep angles however, it is still possible to have extreme forward or aft sweep angles with low AR wings or vice versa.
# Note that there is difficulty in setting the AlphaL0_Distribution and Washout_Distribution before the grid independence study is complete as the m value will change, hence the detail required in the distributions will change. For this reason, the distributions must be updated below within the planform optimization code if they are not a constant
FreeStream_Velocity=10 # In metres per second (note that the faster the freestream velocity, the smaller the induced angle of attack)
Sigma_SpanRatio=4/3
m=599 # WARNING: MUST BE AN ODD NUMBER (so that one point is at the centreline of the distribution)
b=3 # Wingspan in Metres
Root_Chord=0.5 # Root chord in metres
Quarter_Chord_Sweep_Angle_Deg=30 # Quarter chord sweep angle in degrees (note that aft sweep is positive)
Mach_Number=FreeStream_Velocity/339.242732420313 # Note that a value of zero still provides valid results but does not account for the effects of compressibility
CL_RealWorld=2*pi # Set to 2*pi for theoretical value or change to the known 3D experiemental value
Design_AoA_Deg=5 # With reference to the root chord
Geometric_Twist_Distribution_Deg=0 # With reference to the root chord. Note that due to the way this method treats the airfoil as a flat plate, this is a modification to the AlphaL0_Distribution and as such a negative washout actually increases lift rather than decreasing it (this is accounted for in the Weissinger code by reversing the sign of the geometric twist when calculating Alpha)
AlphaL0_Root_Deg=-6.36363636363636
AlphaL0_Tip_Deg=0
Plotter_Step_Size=0.01
